### First post
This is my first blog post with Jekyll, a Open-Source static site generator made in the Ruby language. This blog is a platform for me to showcase and write about what I learn in Java full stack web development, some topics on cybersecurity, productivity, and awesome resources I found helpful in my learning and among my peers on my journey.

A quote to end on a positive note about starting anything new and favorite of is: 
> A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” —Lao Tzu
