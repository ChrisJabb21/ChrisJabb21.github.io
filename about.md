My name is Christopher Fouad Jabbour. My alma mater is Saint Vincent College for my Bachelors Arts in Liberal Arts (concentration in Bioinformatics) with a minor in Computer Science and Masters of Science in Cybersecurity from Robert Morris University in Pittsburgh, PA.

I am a Java Full Stack Web Developer from Pittsburgh PA, USA. My educational background was cybersecurity and I found my way into web development which became my main focus and I always love to learn new things from tech as well as writing. I love to learn art as well and different languages (not just programming languages).

I believe there is always something to learn and the bus never stops on education and keeping our mind open to changes.
